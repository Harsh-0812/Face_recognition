# üë§ Face Recognition GUI App

A desktop GUI application for real-time face detection, recognition, age/gender prediction, and emotion detection using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and deep learning models.

---

## üì∏ Features

- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascades
- Face data collection via webcam or video
- Train a face recognition model using LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms)
- Emotion detection using a CNN model
- Age and gender prediction using pre-trained models
- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter

---

## üß† How It Works

1. **Capture Face Data**
   - Users can record their face using the webcam or a video file
   - Up to 300 images per person are captured and stored in a `/data` folder

2. **Train Face Classifier**
   - The app uses OpenCV‚Äôs `LBPHFaceRecognizer` to train a classifier for each user

3. **Run Face Recognition**
   - On running, it recognizes the user in real time
   - Predicts **age**, **gender**, and **emotion**
